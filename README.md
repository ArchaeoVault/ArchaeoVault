## Git Workflow Instructions

1. Open the source control panel in VSCode 

2. Create a new local branch where you will be writing your code by opening the menu by: 

    a. Clicking on the 3 dots at the top of the panel 

    b. Hover over Branch -> click on Create Branch from -> choose main

    c. Enter the branch name as ArchaeoVault-User story number. For example ArchaeoVault-27 

3. Make sure to commit your work often with descriptive commit messages (You must stage the changes you want to commit by pressing the plus button next to the change before you can commit)

4. When you are ready to push your changes to the main branch: 

    a. Make sure all your work is committed  

    b. Pull any changes from the main branch. By opening the menu -> hovering over the Pull, Push option -> Pull from -> origin -> origin/main

    c. Resolve merge conflicts if there are any 

    d. Commit and new changes that may have been made when resolving conflicts 

    e. Push to origin/main from the Pull, Push menu and then by clicking the push to option. Then open a pull request with the branch name and the a longer description of the user story in the title and give a description! To do this visit the repository homepage on github and you should see a notifcation on the screen asking if you want to create a pull request.

    For example:
    Title - ArchaeoVault-27; Description - Added instructions on the git workflow to the readme file


5. Once a teammate has accepted your pull request your changes have been added to the main branch!
